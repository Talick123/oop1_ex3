General Description of the Assignment:
  In this assignment, we were requested to implement classes and functions that
  allow representation and manipulation of polynomials.

Design:
  Classes: Poly, List, Rational
    Rational
    - deals with the construction and representation of rational numbers in Polynomials (the coefficient)
    - contains functions used for mathematical operations
   TermList
   - deals with the memory allocation for a list of structures
   - contains functions used for memory allocation and release
   Poly
   - deals with the mathematical operations of polynomials represented as a list of structures

 Structures: Term
   Term
   - structure containing an exponential value, variable of type Rational and pointer to next structure


Files:
  Poly.h and Poly.cpp
    - files containing the Poly class and global functions used to manipulate variables of type Poly
  TermList.h and TermList.cpp
    - files containing the TermList class and global functions used to add, remove or manipulate variables of type TermList
  Rational.h and Rational.cpp
    - files containing the Rational class and global functions used for mathematical operations and simplifications of variables of type Rational
  Term.h
    - file containing struct Term that represents the exponential value and the coefficient (Rational) of a term in a polynomial (as well as pointer to next struct)

Main Data Structures and their Jobs:
	- see Design above

Notable Algorithms:
	- *multiplying???

Known Bugs:
	- there are no known bugs in the program

Other General Notes:
	- none



==================================================================================================

Classes:

 Poly
	Description: represent polynom (over Q), responsible for
	mathematical behaviours (not memory management)

	Members:
		- poli list

	Member functions:
		- deg (get degree of index)
		- constructor
		- deconstrucor
		- copy constructor
		- all operation functions


Rational
	Description: represent rational number by numerator denominator. Responsible for

	Members:
		- numerator
		- denominator

	Member functions:
		- deg (get degree)
		-

TermList:
	Description: list of Term structs, responsible for
	memory and data structure management

	Members:
		struct Coeffic *

	Member Functions:
		-



Structs:

Term
	- int degree
	- Rational coeffic
	- next Coeffic
