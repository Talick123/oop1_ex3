General Description of the Assignment:
  In this assignment, we were requested to implement classes and functions that
  allow representation and manipulation of polynomials.





Classes:

 Poly
	Description: represent polynom (over Q), responsible for
	mathematical behaviours (not memory management)

	Members:
		- poli list

	Member functions:
		- deg (get degree of index)
		- constructor
		- deconstrucor
		- copy constructor
		- all operation functions


Rational
	Description: represent rational number by numerator denominator. Responsible for

	Members:
		- numerator
		- denominator

	Member functions:
		- deg (get degree)
		-

TermList:
	Description: list of Term structs, responsible for
	memory and data structure management

	Members:
		struct Coeffic *

	Member Functions:
		-



Structs:

Term
	- int degree
	- Rational coeffic
	- next Coeffic
